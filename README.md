# webscrape
A program that scrapes information and monitors changes on a website.
This project was super difficult for me because I didn't have too much prior knowledge on programming before this, so I didn't get certain parts like twilio part to work. But I did get the beautifulsoup and the rest of the webscaping code like the loop to send a message when a string is different from before on a webpage.
